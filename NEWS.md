# 0.1.0 

The initial version of `politicaldata` has been submitted to CRAN with functions to extract data from web pages directly into R and several datasets for analyzing Congressional legislator ideologies, election polling, and election results. You can use the beginnings of an API for data from the Comparative Agendas Project, which will be a large focus of this package's codebase moving forward.

# 0.1.1

`politicaldata` underwent changes for resubmission to CRAN.

# 0.1.2

The dependency structure of `politicaldata` has been substantially reduced and bug fixes were made to the data generating scripts for the `pres_results` data frame that were causing vote shares to be divided by about 1e06.

# 0.1.3

The data underpinning various elections functions in `politicaldata` has been revised to reflect changes in MIT data sources.
