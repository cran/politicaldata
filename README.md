[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/elliottmorris/politicaldata.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/elliottmorris/politicaldata) 0.1.1

An R package for acquiring and analyzing political data â€” including polls, election results, legislator information, and demographic data.

Author: [G. Elliott Morris](https://www.thecrosstab.com)

For more, see [the package's project description my blog](https://www.thecrosstab.com/project/politicaldata-package/) or [view the vignettes](https://github.com/elliottmorris/politicaldata) *(vignettes area work in progress)*. You can find many examples of how these data are used in the real world via my interactive R course at DataCamp.com, ["Analyzing Election and Polling Data in R"](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/analyzing-election-and-polling-data-in-r).

I've written a detailed guide on using R for analyzing political data, [*A Guide to Analyzing (American) Political Data in R*](https://www.thecrosstab.com/project/guide), that uses many of the functions and datasets from this package. If you want use cases that extend beyond the examples in the function documentation, this is a good place to start.

Installation
============

The `politicaldata` package is pending approval on CRAN.

As the landscape of online data and API calls is constantly changing, the development version is likely more useful. anyways You should familiarize yourself with the `remotes::install_github()` workflow below:

To get the current development version from GitHub:

``` r
## install the remotes package if it's not already
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}

## install dev version of rtweet from github
remotes::install_github("elliottmorris/politicaldata")

## load rtweet package
library(politicaldata)
```

Usage
=====

This package provides a variety of functions for quickly accessing different data sources used in political science and analytics. For example, you can download a data.frame of the DW-NOMINATE scores of congressional ideology computed by the [VoteView](https://voteview.com) project at UCLA:

``` r
# import the package
library(politicaldata)

# download the NOMINATE scores for the 116th House
house_ideo <- get_house_nominate(congress = 116)

# download the NOMINATE scores for the Senate in the 116th Congress
senate_ideo <- get_senate_nominate(congress = 116)

# take a look with dplyr::head()
suppressMessages(library(dplyr))

head(house_ideo[1:5])
#>   congress chamber icpsr state_icpsr district_code
#> 1      116   House 20301          41             3
#> 2      116   House 21102          41             7
#> 3      116   House 21192          41             2
#> 4      116   House 21193          41             5
#> 5      116   House 21376          41             1
#> 6      116   House 21500          41             6
```

**A list of functions:**

-   `get_house_nominate()` returns [DW-NOMINATE](https://www.voteview.com/about) ideology scores for each member of the U.S. House of Representatives for a specified congress, else every Representative ever.
-   `get_senate_nominate()` returns [DW-NOMINATE](https://www.voteview.com/about) ideology scores for each member of the U.S. Senate for a specified congress, else every Senator ever.
-   `trump_approval_polls_538()` returns a dataset of approval polls [aggregated by](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/) the folks over at FiveThirtyEight.
-   `get_cap_mip()` returns a historical dataset of the aggregated responses to Gallup's Most Important Problem questions, coded by major topic. Part of a suite of functions for obtaining data from the [Comparative Agendas Project](https://www.comparativeagendas.net).

**A list of datasets:**

-   `house_116` is a saved copy of the output from `get_house_nominate(congress=116)` run on the last day the package was updated (and thus should only be used for demos, unless you want outdated data).
-   `senate_116` is the same as the above, bur for the Senate. Downloaded via `get_senate_nominate(congress=116)`.
-   `us_polls_history` is a dataset of US presidential election polling from the 1980 through 2016 elections.
-   `house_results` is a dataset of results for elections to the US House of Representatives that occurred from 1976 to 2018
-   `pres_results_by_cd` is a dataset of results for presidential elections broken down by congressional district from 1990 to 2016

Suggested related packages:
===========================

-   `Rvoteview` provides functions for obtaining roll call voting data, which can thus be analyzed using algorithms from the `pscl` package.
-   `ropercenter` allows you import data from the Roper Center's iPoll directly in R, given that you know the slug of the interested poll.
-   `fivethirtyeight` was developed to distribute the data behind the popular data journalism website, and thus will have some overlap. FiveThirtyEight also releases most of their data [on GitHub](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data).
-   `pollstR` provides a way to access the aggregate toplines from Huffington Post Pollster, which is sadly no longer being updated.
